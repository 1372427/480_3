##Explanation of App

Trying to make this application was much harder than the other assignments because I couldn't test it well. Even on my computer, the camera would not recognize the image for the floor, so I could not easily test the scale of my objects. In general, I was trying to make an application which would help potential pet owners by letting them preview the space each respective pet would take. Since I wanted to make sure the scale was passable, I didn't try and add any interactions other than placing the objects on the floor, though I originally wanted to add gravity for the objects and have them fall to the ground, like suggested in the assignment description. 

##Overall Thoughts

In general, I think this kind of application is very useful. For example, the Ikea app would be nice because it would allow a temporary preview before a major commitment of buying some piece of furniture. I am still skeptical about how well it works, however, as I don't believe the scale can be entirely accurate. This kind of adding virtual objects to a real space also seems to be helpful in terms of providing instructions (such as the espresso machine), as well as perhaps hiding fun notes or secrets for others to find. I think, if developed further, it can lead to greater creativity and more engaging education.
